**Image Segmentation using Otsu and texture-based approaches:**

In this homework Otsu and texture based segmentation approaches were
implemented and tested. The brief overview of the implemented approaches
is as follows:

1.  The Otsu approach was used to identify the gray level from a
    grayscale image that can best separate the foreground and
    background. The threshold was obtained for individual RGB channel in
    an image and were later combined using the logical ‘AND’ operator.

2.  The texture based segmentation utilize a sliding window to compute
    the local variance followed by application of the Otsu thresholding
    algorithm was used to obtain the best segmenting gray levels by
    treating each window size as a separate channel of image.

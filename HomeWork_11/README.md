## **Face Recognition using Principal Component (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) + Object Detection using Cascaded Adaboost Algorithm**

There were two tasks for this homework. In the first task, face
recognition was done as follows:

1.  Reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional image data to low
    dimensional space using principal component analysis (PCA) and
    linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

2.  Use the data from reduced space to build a nearest neighbor
    classifier.

For the second task we developed a car detector using cascaded AdaBoost
algorithm with an arbitrarily defined false positive rate.

**Results:**

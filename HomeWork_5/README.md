**Image stitching using SIFT features, RANSAC algorithm with linear and
non-linear Homography estimation/ refinement**

This homework generates panorama using five overlapping images. The
brief overview of the method used is as follows:

1.  In the first step, SIFT operator from the OpenCV was used to extract
    the key features of an image. The SIFT features were then used
    together with normalized cross-correlation (NCC) to establish the
    correspondences between an image pair.

2.  In order to remove the false correspondences, we used the random
    sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to find only the inliers. These
    inliers were then used to find the homographies using linear least
    squares approach.

3.  Finally, we used Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to further
    refine the homogrpahies in non-linear fashion. The LM method used
    the homographies estimated in earlier step as initial guess.
